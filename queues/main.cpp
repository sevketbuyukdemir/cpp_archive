/**
 * Queue : A data structure in which the elements are added at one end, called the rear,
 * and deleted from the other end, called the front; a FIRST IN FIRST OUT (FIFO) data
 * structure.
 *
 * Necessary Queue operations :
 *      * initialize_queue
 *      * is_empty_queue
 *      * is_full_queue
 *      * front
 *      * back
 *      * add_queue
 *      * delete_queue
 *
 * You can implement Queues with both linked list and array.
